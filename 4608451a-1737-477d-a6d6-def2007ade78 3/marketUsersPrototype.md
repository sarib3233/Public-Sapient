## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that users want to go to palces they know and what there is to do there. In the survery nearly 40% of people said that "I know what type of vacation I want, but haven't settled on a destination", I noticed that in the video someone is less likley to select a vacation spot that they haven't heard of before. A pain point was that for someone wanting to travel with a family, they don't really care about what ammeneties a rental has but they want to know what there is to do in the place where it's located.
